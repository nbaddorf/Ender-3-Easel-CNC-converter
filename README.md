# Ender-3-Easel-CNC-converter
I made this python program that takes gcode from easel and converts it to work with the Ender 3. Right now the program is setup for pen plotting. THIS IS NOT FINISHED. NOT MY FAULT IF YOUR PRINTER BREAKS FROM THIS.

To use: open Easel: https://easel.inventables.com
Make a new project
Click on Machine and then set the Work area X and Y to 235mm
Next select material size and set X and Y to 234.9mm and Z thickness to 1mm
Select Cut Settings and set Feed Rate to what ever you want. I recommend 700mm/m for starting off.
Set Plunge Rate to 50.0mm/m
Set Depth Per Pass to 1mm
Finally import your designing into Easel, set the cut depth of the model to 1mm. To do this, click on the object you added and select Cut and drag the slider to 1mm.
